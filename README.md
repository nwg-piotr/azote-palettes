# azote-palettes
This tool creates a palette of up to 36 colours out of a jpg or png image. Click a colour button to find:

- Colour value converted into CMYK color model;
- name of the nearest colour according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F);
- name of the nearest colour on the Pantone C scale.

The program utilizes GTK+3 and the awesome [colorthief](https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py) python module. 
Some snippets were written by wise people and found by me on StackOverflow. See comments inside the code.
